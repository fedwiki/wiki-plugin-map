# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Map Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The map plugin displays a map. Scrolling and zooming are actions that are saved in the journal.
